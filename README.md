# XamarinForms-NavigationBug

> To reproduce the bug launch the application and click the `Next Page` button to make sure the navigation works as it should.
> Next go to MainActivity check if the LaunchMode is set to SingleTop, and uncomment the Nagivation line in the `OnCreate()` method in MainActivity.
> Start the application and try to navigate backwards to the root page.
